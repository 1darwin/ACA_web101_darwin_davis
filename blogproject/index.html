            <span class="date">October 1st, 2019</span>
            <p>Coding excites and interests me because I'm always coming up with new ideas and learning coding is a way for me to put those ideas to work and try to create something special.  And I’m always asking myself,  “How did they did that?”</p>

            <h2>Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.</h2>
            <span class="date">October 1st, 2019</span>
            <p>The browser reads each CSS file from top to bottom and the last element read is the one selected.  If there are multiple CSS files and an element appears in multiple files, the one that is last in the last html file is the one that is used for formatting.</p>

            <h2>What's the difference between element and tag?</h2>
            <span class="date">October 1st, 2019</span>
            <p> An element is a set of opening and closing tags. Tags are labels that are marked up at the beginning and the end of an element. All tags begin with a less-than sign, <, and end with a greater-than sign >, the only difference between an opening tag and a closing tag is the forward slash /.  </p>

            <h2>What do you think the "Cascade" is? How do you explain it?</h2>
            <span class="date">October 1st, 2019</span>
            <p>Cascading means that styles can fall (or cascade) from one style sheet to another, enabling multiple style sheets to be used on one HTML document.</p>

            <span class="date">October 1st, 2019</span>
            <p>It’s like putting a suit (CSS) on someone who just has on underwear and a t-shirt (HTML).  HTML only allows for a vanilla website while adding CSS allow the website to be dressed up with all the bells and whistles.</p>
